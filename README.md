Hey there! This is Go Log OS, a attendance system for teachers in my school. It's my personal project under active development. It isn't documented well yet, but [here](https://almondine-chickadee-23a.notion.site/Go-Log-OS-198b83fbd4d980fd8c49faf425e3ba16?pvs=4) are links to parts of the planning, code, and design, as well as a quick demo.
